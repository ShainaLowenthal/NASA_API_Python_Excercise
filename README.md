# NASA_API_Python_Excercise

Guidlines of excercise:
Use the [NASA Mars Photo API](https://api.nasa.gov/) to do the following:
1. Download all photos from 02/02/2016 and upload them to cloud storage. Alternatively, zip the files and e-mail them to us.
* We donâ€™t have a preference of which cloud storage platform you decide to you.
* Write code to upload your files to the cloud storage.
* Please ensure we can view the files.
2. Export all metadata for each photo to a csv file. Wherever you chose to store your images, include this csv in the same manner.
